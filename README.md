# MSMU Library Website Redesign 
These are a few examples of navigational layouts and mockups I've created for the redesign of the MSMU library's website. 

I started the process by meeting with the Web Development and Redesign Committee to gather input and assess current content, function, and layout. The goal was to target weaknesses in the current site and come up with solutions to better adapt the library website to serve as an effective library communications and research tool for the benefit of faculty, students, and university constituents.

<h2>Project Scope</h2>
<ul>
<li>Review and assess the current content, function, layout, and navigational effectiveness of the library web site.</li>
<li>Develop a contextual definition of the anticipated purpose and functionality of a redesigned web site for review and endorsement by the Library Advisory Council and Interim Director of Libraries.</li>
<li>Review the web configuration of other library websites to find effective models of design and functionality.</li>
<li>Make recommendations as to how the web page (landing page) may be changed to make navigation easy and effective as a research tool and major library publication/communications for the benefit of the faculty, students, and university constituent groups (including external clientele).</li>
<li>Develop 2-3 wireframes (architectural configurations) for the landing and content pages for illustrative purposes, including consolidation, rewording and/or elimination of existing headings as appropriate.</li>
<li>Recommend new or revised content pages,  as needed, to enhance the utility of the site and its capacity to educate and to enhance the outreach services and the image of the library as a learning commons.</li>
<li>Test the usability of the web site with our students and other users as a component of construction.</li>
<li>Develop and recommend web guidelines as to language, page format, and number of clicks desired from landing page to content,  to serve as a template and  guide for those who contribute to future web development for the MSMU Libraries.</li>
</ul>
